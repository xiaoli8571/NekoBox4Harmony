# Phase A-D Implementation Status

## Scope and constraints

Implementation was limited to `entry/src/main/ets/`, `entry/src/main/resources/`, and this root `CHANGES.md`. No build, package, signing, version, permission, module declaration, frozen core, CGo, binary, generated-output, or Git write operation was performed.

## Phase A

### A1 Grouped node management: Completed

- Added `ProfileGroup` and group/sort metadata to profiles.
- Added compatible persistence for groups and legacy profiles.
- Added grouped display and node movement/group management flows on the home page.

Files:
- `entry/src/main/ets/model/Profile.ets`
- `entry/src/main/ets/model/Store.ets`
- `entry/src/main/ets/pages/Index.ets`

### A2 Live ProfileEdit validation: Completed

- Added reusable validation for server, port range, UUID, protocol credentials, REALITY public key/short ID, and optional JSON.
- Invalid profiles are blocked from saving and validation feedback is shown while editing.

Files:
- `entry/src/main/ets/pages/ProfileEdit.ets`

### A3 Appearance settings: Completed with API limitation

- Added persisted system/light/dark preference, haptic-feedback preference, and liquid-glass preference.
- Added settings controls for these options.
- Current SDK/project APIs do not provide a safe, already-declared path to force every page and process to change color mode immediately. Some pages may require re-entry to refresh, and liquid-glass/haptic preferences are retained for compatible UI interactions rather than relying on protected APIs or permissions.

Files:
- `entry/src/main/ets/model/Profile.ets`
- `entry/src/main/ets/model/Store.ets`
- `entry/src/main/ets/pages/SettingsPage.ets`

## Phase B

### B1 Latency testing and per-app selection: Completed with API limitation

- Existing latency tester is integrated with the home node list and supports batch testing/status display.
- Per-app include/exclude/off modes are persisted and passed to the VPN configuration through the existing trusted/blocked application APIs.
- Installed-application enumeration is not implemented because the current project does not expose a suitable permission-free bundle-query API. The selector therefore accepts application bundle names manually.

Files:
- `entry/src/main/ets/model/Profile.ets`
- `entry/src/main/ets/pages/Index.ets`
- `entry/src/main/ets/pages/SettingsPage.ets`
- Existing integration verified in `entry/src/main/ets/utils/LatencyTester.ets`
- Existing VPN integration verified in `entry/src/main/ets/vpnext/VpnExtAbility.ets`

### B2 Custom routing and ConfigBuilder integration: Completed

- Custom domain, IP/CIDR, GeoIP, and GeoSite rules are persisted and editable through the existing route-rules page.
- Enabled rules are converted to sing-box route rules and inserted with stable priority after DNS/private safety rules and before legacy direct lists/final routing.
- VPN startup loads the persisted rules and supplies them to the existing ConfigBuilder API.

Files:
- `entry/src/main/ets/model/RouteRule.ets`
- Existing UI verified in `entry/src/main/ets/pages/RouteRulesPage.ets`
- Existing builder integration verified in `entry/src/main/ets/core/ConfigBuilder.ets`
- Existing startup integration verified in `entry/src/main/ets/vpnext/VpnExtAbility.ets`

## Phase C

### C1 Subscription scheduling and metadata: Completed with API limitation

- Added per-subscription update interval, next-update time, last-attempt time, and last-error metadata with legacy-data defaults.
- Existing traffic quota and expiry metadata remain preserved and displayed.
- Due subscriptions are checked when the application starts or returns to its active flow.
- Exact background scheduling is not available without adding protected configuration, permissions, or a background task declaration, so updates are not guaranteed while the application is terminated.

Files:
- `entry/src/main/ets/core/Subscriptions.ets`
- `entry/src/main/ets/pages/Index.ets`
- Existing subscription UI verified in `entry/src/main/ets/pages/SettingsPage.ets`
- Existing detail UI verified in `entry/src/main/ets/pages/SubDetailPage.ets`

### C2 Share-link import and backup/restore: Completed with API limitation

- Clipboard import uses the existing pasteboard helper.
- Six required protocols are supported by the existing parser: `ss://`, `vmess://`, `vless://`, `trojan://`, `hysteria2://`, and `tuic://`.
- Import flow handles parsed profiles and duplicate/error feedback through the current home-page workflow.
- Backup schema was advanced to version 3 and now includes settings, profiles, groups, subscriptions, and custom routing rules while accepting older backups with missing optional fields.
- Clipboard backup/restore UI is available. File-picker backup/restore was not added because no suitable existing file-selection API is present and adding new declarations or permissions was prohibited.

Files:
- `entry/src/main/ets/core/Backup.ets`
- `entry/src/main/ets/pages/Index.ets`
- `entry/src/main/ets/pages/SettingsPage.ets`
- Existing parser verified in `entry/src/main/ets/utils/LinkParser.ets`
- Existing clipboard helper verified in `entry/src/main/ets/utils/ClipboardHelper.ets`

## Phase D

### D1 Localization and dark-mode polish: Partially completed

- New appearance controls and backup descriptions were added and affected pages continue to use existing theme resources where already available.
- Full extraction of all legacy hard-coded strings and a complete English resource set was not safely completed in this pass. Several existing pages still contain Chinese literals and fixed colors. This remains a localization and dark-mode consistency risk.

Files:
- `entry/src/main/ets/pages/SettingsPage.ets`
- Existing resources reviewed in `entry/src/main/resources/base/element/color.json`
- Existing resources reviewed in `entry/src/main/resources/base/element/string.json`

### D2 Notification enhancement and desktop card: API-limited

- Existing ongoing VPN notification already displays connected state and the current node name.
- A reliable live-latency value is UI-process state and is not currently shared with the VPN extension process, so latency was not added to the notification without changing cross-process interfaces.
- A notification VPN toggle was not added because no safe existing action-agent/want-agent flow was available in the current project APIs without broadening system integration.
- Desktop service card was skipped because it requires module/form declarations in protected configuration such as `module.json5` and additional resources.

Existing notification files reviewed:
- `entry/src/main/ets/entryability/EntryAbility.ets`
- `entry/src/main/ets/vpnext/VpnExtAbility.ets`

## Exact modified file list

- `entry/src/main/ets/core/Backup.ets`
- `entry/src/main/ets/core/Subscriptions.ets`
- `entry/src/main/ets/model/Profile.ets`
- `entry/src/main/ets/model/RouteRule.ets`
- `entry/src/main/ets/model/Store.ets`
- `entry/src/main/ets/pages/Index.ets`
- `entry/src/main/ets/pages/ProfileEdit.ets`
- `entry/src/main/ets/pages/SettingsPage.ets`
- `CHANGES.md`

## Static verification

- `git diff --check` completed without whitespace errors before final documentation.
- Read-only `git status --short`, `git diff --name-only`, source searches, and API consistency inspection were used.
- No build, package, Hvigor, HAP, kernel, or signing command was run.
- No commit, checkout, reset, add, stash, merge, rebase, or push operation was run.

## Pre-existing repository state and risks

- `core/sing-box-1.13.12` was already reported modified at inspection time and was not touched by this implementation.
- Pre-existing untracked `.zcode/`, crash dumps, and `nul` were not modified.
- Build/type verification remains outstanding because the request explicitly prohibited building.
- Full localization, immediate global theme application, installed-app enumeration, exact terminated-state subscription scheduling, file-picker backup/restore, live notification latency/toggle actions, and the desktop card remain limited by current APIs or protected configuration constraints.

## 2026-09-03 F2 通知栏增强：已完成，待构建机编译与真机验证

- 新增 UI 进程到 VPN 扩展进程的测速 CommonEvent，仅在当前运行节点测速完成后发送节点名称与延迟。
- VPN 常驻通知现在显示“当前节点 · 延迟”，尚未测速或测速失败时显示 `--`。
- 常驻通知新增“断开”按钮，通过 WantAgent 拉起 EntryAbility 并携带 `action=disconnect`。
- EntryAbility 在 `onCreate()` 与 `onNewWant()` 中处理通知动作，调用现有 `VpnService.disconnect()`，覆盖应用未运行及已运行场景。

改动文件：
- `entry/src/main/ets/core/VpnIpc.ets`
- `entry/src/main/ets/pages/Index.ets`
- `entry/src/main/ets/vpnext/VpnExtAbility.ets`
- `entry/src/main/ets/entryability/EntryAbility.ets`
- `DEVPLAN.md`
- `CHANGES.md`

静态检查与限制：
- `git diff --check` 已通过，无空白错误。
- 已核对测速事件发布、扩展进程订阅、通知按钮及 `onNewWant()` 处理链路。
- 按约束未执行构建、打包或任何 Git 写操作。
- Notification ActionButton、WantAgent 拉起行为及跨进程 CommonEvent 仍需构建机编译和真机验证。
